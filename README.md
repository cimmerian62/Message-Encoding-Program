# Message-Encoding-Program
This program encodes a message by taking a key of characters, and in sequence, adds the ascii value of the characters in the 
key to the the ascii value of the character in the message. If the new ascii value is greater than 'z', the value wraps back around to 'a' and keeps adding.
The message is decoded by subtracting the key from the encoded message.
